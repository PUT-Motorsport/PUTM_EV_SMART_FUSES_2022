 *  		||  ABC of fuses library with PUT Motosport   ||
 *  		================================================
 *
 *  1. 	Unfortunately compiler for some reasons can mess up template compiling
 *  	so it became a necessity to hint compiler in the hpp file what types of templates
 *  	we need - at the bottom of this file there is a hinting section.
 *
 *  2.	Most of values have their explanation in place so definitely check those.
 *
 *  3.	Fuses use a handler object, which handles all fuses, which needs to be called every
 *  	loop iteration.
 *
 *  4.  Well settings are a mess i guess.
 *
 *  5. 	How to pro
